# **Meal_finder**

Welcome to **Meal_finder**! This is a practice project I built as part of a learning course offered by **Hola Mundo Academy**. The application is designed to explore recipes using the [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/) and serves as a practical exercise in frontend development.

While the project concept comes from the course, I have implemented it to strengthen my skills in React, TypeScript, and styling with ChakraUI.

## **Features**

- **Search for Meals**: Quickly find meals by name.  
- **Browse Categories**: Explore meals grouped by categories or cuisines.  
- **Detailed Meal Info**: View full recipes with instructions, ingredients, and a preview image.  
- **Responsive UI**: Built with ChakraUI for a seamless experience across devices.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend Framework**: React (with TypeScript)  
- **Build Tool**: Vite  
- **Styling**: ChakraUI  
- **API**: [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version X.X.X or later)

    Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser to view the app.

Why I Built This

This app was built as part of a hands-on exercise from a Hola Mundo Academy course. It has been an excellent opportunity to:

    Learn how to work with external APIs to fetch and display dynamic data.
    Practice using Vite as a modern build tool and TypeScript for type safety.
    Design responsive and accessible user interfaces with ChakraUI.

While the project isn't original and follows the course guidelines, it represents my progress and dedication to mastering web development technologies.
Acknowledgements
